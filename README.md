# midterm-two-makeup

Netlify kept crashing for me and would not work. so I'm putting my code here.<br>

Link to refactored program: https://pycoder49.github.io/midterm-two-makeup/
<br>

- index.html inside root is a dummy index.html that points to the real one inside the refactored code.
- All three files are inside the refactored code.
- The original HTML file is in the root.
